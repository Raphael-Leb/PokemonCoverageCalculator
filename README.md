There is still much to do, but the app is functionnal for now. Planned features include but are not limited to:
- Better page formatting
- More images
- Pokemon selection instead of types
- Charts that don't act up on mobile
- Taking for account abilities and items such as levitate and air balloon
- Make the app suggest the best options
